# Aligator üêä

Post-Installation script for Ubuntu / Pop OS. I made this program to install most of my favourite Linux packages easily.

- This will change your current shell to **Fish shell.**
- This will change your current shell prompt to **Starship.**
- This will change your current terminal to **Kitty.**
- This will also install several other applications/tools.
